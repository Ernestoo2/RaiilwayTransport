## Overview 📚

The **Transport System Application** is a web-based solution designed to enhance transportation systems by providing users with a seamless and efficient experience. Built with **React** and **TypeScript**, this application adopts modern web development practices to ensure a highly responsive and user-friendly platform.

This project follows a structured approach for scalability, maintainability, and clarity, making it an excellent foundation for future enhancements. Key features include **dynamic routing**, **reusable components**, and **skeleton loading screens** to improve user experience.

## Goals and Objectives 🎯

The application addresses core challenges in transportation management by providing:

- **Streamlined Booking Process**: Users can search for trains, view routes, and book tickets effortlessly.
- **Real-time Updates**: Ensures users stay informed about routes, bookings, and schedules.
- **Improved User Experience**: Uses skeleton screens and responsive UI to reduce frustration caused by slow loading times.
- **Scalability**: A modular architecture allows for future expansion without compromising performance.

## Project Structure 📂

The project follows a **React TypeScript Template Structure** for modularity and maintainability. Below is the folder breakdown:

### **`src/` Folder** (Core Application Files)

- **`components/`** - Reusable UI components like buttons, forms, and loaders.
- **`layout/`** - Manages overall page layout (header, footer, navigation).
- **`pages/`** - Contains main application pages (Landing Page, Login, Train Search).
- **`styles/`** - Houses global and component-specific CSS files.
- **`ui/`** - UI components such as booking interfaces and skeleton loaders.
- **`utils/`** - Utility functions, API configurations, and helper functions.
- **`App.tsx`** - Entry point where routes and core logic are defined.

### **`public/` Folder** (Static Files)

- **`index.html`** - Root HTML template for the React application.
- **`assets/`** - Stores images, icons, and other static resources.

### **Other Key Files**

- **`package.json`** - Manages dependencies and scripts.
- **`node_modules/`** - Stores installed dependencies.
